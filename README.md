# Nanoplastics and Co-pollutants Negatively Affect the Photosynthesis of Photosynthetic Organisms: Insights from Meta-analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains the data and code for our manuscript: "Nanoplastics and Co-pollutants Negatively Affect the Photosynthesis of Photosynthetic Organisms: Insights from Meta-analysis and Machine Learning".

This project develops and applies a machine learning and meta-analysis framework to analyse the effects of nanoplastics and co-pollutants on the photosynthesis of photosynthetic organisms. The framework focuses on two primary predictive tasks:
1. Systematically evaluating the phytotoxic effects of nanoplastics and co-occurring environmental pollutants.
2. Elucidating the quantitative relationships between the properties of nanoplastics and co-occurring pollutants and the resulting photosynthetic responses under varying experimental conditions.
